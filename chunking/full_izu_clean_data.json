Even after only spending a few weeks here, I just know that Erasmus- but especially Erasmus here, has been one of best decisions of my life. Apart from amazing University programs classes, IZU has made most welcoming heartwarming atmosphere for me. Attending classes club programs University has prepared for us gives emphasis on how much they care about diversity of social educational life of their students. No matter what study what your days look like, can always find time get interested into something that is going on in campus. Who would even dare to describe Istanbul all its wonders? If I may, first thing I would say that it is tireless makes fall in love with life even more. It is impossible to get to know it in a short time, it seeks out to wander around. Orientation week gave us a perfect glimpse into adventure that was ahead of us. From mesmerizing cuisine, epic history tradition, cultural sights charming overall energy of city. Being alone in a city that could easily be described as capital of world has not bee lonely even for a moment. Just knowing that have a such an amazing group of friends made here, most wonderful university where are never bored, someone looking out for at all times is a thing that will stick with you- always. Dear IZU, I just got here, I already don't know how I will ever leave… Sincerely, Edita Krušlin"

It may become even harder to find jobs. Therefore, continuing our work with current methods in field of education does not seem feasible. Especially in this digital age, we must consider every possibility when it comes to learning.\" THE CONGRESS WILL CONTINUE ONLINE OVER THE WEEKEND The first speaker of day, Prof. Dr. Münevver Çetin, highlighted effects of digital transformation in higher education in her presentation titled \"Digital Ecosystem in Higher Education: The Changing Role of Academics New Generation Teaching Methods.\" Prof. Dr. Tuncay Dilci, in his talk on \"Problematic Use of Digital Objects,\" shared insights into conscious use of digital tools.

The event brought together eager to experience legislative processes of Grand National Assembly of Türkiye. During program, took on role of members of parliament, proposing bills engaging with legislative process. Held at Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University, simulation provided participants with a parliament experience that felt incredibly real. Among attendees were AK Party Istanbul Deputy Av. Nurettin Alan, President of Bar Association No. 2 Av. Yasin Şamlı, IZU Vice Rector Prof. Dr. Erhan İçener, IZU Faculty of Law Vice Dean Dr. Halit Serhan Ercivelek, along with many professionals from fields of law, academia, politics. ALAN: PARLIAMENT IS THE CENTER OF CURRENT POLITICS In his opening speech, AK Party Istanbul Deputy Av. Nurettin Alan stated that should become \"legal engineers\" who actively shape legislation. He continued: “Simulations like these don’t just help you learn existing laws they help you become individuals who discuss, improve, guide future legislation. Parliament is also center of current politics. Everything that concerns society is discussed there. In fact, many of headlines you see in news come from parliament. Historically, we are children of a glorious civilization. However, this civilization has recently been obscured. You, youth, are ones who will blow truth into ashes reignite its fire.” ŞAMLI: LAW IS NOT JUST LEGISLATION IT IS JUSTICE Bar President Av. Yasin Şamlı recalled past changes in Turkish Penal Code: “At one point, even peaceful protests were tried as attempts to overthrow constitutional order. Even high school demanding right to education were prosecuted with potential death sentences. It wasn’t easy to correct these injustices. That’s why understanding essence of law focusing on justice is so crucial.” Şamlı emphasized that law should not be seen as limited to written rules: “A regulation can be legal but still unfair. Law, at its core, is what is just. Law is a scale.” İÇENER: WE MUST RAISE INDIVIDUALS WHO PRODUCE KNOWLEDGE, NOT JUST CONSUME IT IZU Vice Rector Prof. Dr. Erhan İçener highlighted value of simulation-based learning: “These simulations allow to learn not only through theory but also through role-playing, position-taking, direct debate. When actively engage, learning becomes much more lasting.” He added, “This level of interest gives me hope. Today’s youth are no longer satisfied with just studying they question ideologies, world systems, values of civilization. One foot must stay rooted in our land, other must explore world. That’s how a global perspective is formed. Though AI, social media, rapid information tools save time, they can weaken mental depth. We expect our to be not just consumers of knowledge, but also its producers.” ERCİVELEK: OUR PARLIAMENTARY TRADITION GOES BACK TO CENTRAL ASIA Dr. Halit Serhan Ercivelek, Vice Dean of IZU Faculty of Law, spoke on historical roots of parliament concept: “When we talk about parliament, we usually refer to Western examples. But long before that, in Turkish states of Central Asia, there was a tradition of kurultay assemblies that convened twice a year to elect rulers decide on wars. This is a value rooted in our cultural memory. Parliament is not just an institution it represents collective thinking decision-making.” STUDENTS EXPERIENCED THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS Chaired by Güzide Arslan, a third-year Law student president of Law Club, Zaim Parliament Simulation included workshops, party meetings, committee discussions, general assembly sessions. These activities allowed to gain a deeper understanding of legislative processes. The event helped young participants develop skills in expression, debate, critical thinking on social issues."

In his remarks, he drew attention to challenges currently faced by Muslim societies, using historical legacy of Al-Andalus as a point of reflection. Prof. Dr. Acar stated: “The Islamic state that existed in Andalusia for 800 years played a vital role not only in fields of science culture but also in shaping Western civilization. However, today, traces of this cultural heritage have largely disappeared from Andalusian lands. This tragic ending should serve as a lesson. The current approach of Western world toward Muslim communities in both Turkey Europe is not much different from historical policies toward Andalusia. The genocide in Bosnia attempts to reshape Islam in Albania are examples of this. We must view our differences as strengths unite around shared values. History should be a source of insight, painful experiences of past must not be forgotten. Andalusia is not just a memory of past; it is a legacy that reminds us of our responsibilities for future.” SPEECHES BY AĞIRAKÇA AND ADIGÜZEL Prof. Dr. Ahmet Ağırakça, in his presentation titled “Physicians of Al-Andalus,” discussed contributions of Andalusian doctors to both Islamic world Western medicine.

He stated: “Israel has expanded its attacks towards Lebanon Syria. The 2 billion strong Islamic world, 52 Muslim countries, Organization of Turkish States, Arab League have unfortunately been unable to stop this oppression. We are witnessing how United Nations views Muslims with disdain. As some verses have foretold, we are learning that disbelief is a united force. But why is our situation like this? Because Allah commands unity, yet we choose division. As long as this separation continues, we will keep experiencing this humiliation. This is an imperialist war, a mixed war, a hybrid war, a proxy war using puppets. They exploit all kinds of differences to divide societies. Therefore, we must unite. For 200 years, Islamic world has lagged behind in race for science, industry, technology. Universities you, youth, have a significant responsibility here. We must unite, work hard, become ones who redefine civilization.”"

Before Kuveyt Türk, no bank had advocated for this.”"

Acar: Protecting Intellectual Property Is Becoming Increasingly Difficult In his opening remarks, IZU Rector Prof. Dr. Ahmet Cevat Acar stressed that in today’s rapidly digitalizing world, protection of has become more important than ever. He stated: “In this era of accelerated digitalization where digital materials, products, publications dominate questions remain about how to protect rights manage these processes. Ethical violations within academia, such as copyright infringement, are also part of this issue. Just as protecting tangible economic assets is crucial, safeguarding components such as patents, publications, copyrights is becoming increasingly complex especially under influence of globalization digital communication technologies.” Oğurlu: No Creative Work Can Be Produced Without Protection Balıkesir University Rector Prof. Dr. Yücel Oğurlu emphasized that protection of rights directly impacts creativity production. He remarked: “In countries where Turkey’s is not protected, production of original ideas works becomes impossible. We may spend nights, even weeks, creating just one sentence or paragraph. Among us are poets for whom completing a poem may take an entire year. But if that poem is stolen by someone else, we may lose motivation to ever write again. I personally witnessed how rightful expectations acquired rights were violated in a study I spent three years preparing. Such experiences inevitably weaken our motivation. If we fail to protect these ideals, we cannot set high academic goals, nor can we sustain productivity.” Durak: Companies Now Rely on Intellectual Property Assets President of Turkish Patent Trademark Office, Prof. Dr. Muhammed Zeki Durak, highlighted increasing significance of industrial such as patents, utility models, designs, geographical indications, trademarks in both national economy everyday life.

We are now confronted with new phenomena such as podcasts, streaming services, artificial intelligence. The legal system must adapt to these developments. Technology advances first then law must follow. It is therefore essential that legal system provides fair effective solutions. The collaboration between universities industry will play a critical role in this digital transformation.” Ergül: Producers Assume All Risks MESAM President Recep Ergül emphasized challenges of music production crucial importance of property. He said: “The process of creating a song is akin to childbirth. A poet or composer may spend countless sleepless nights perfecting a work, often revising it repeatedly due to a pursuit of perfection. Eventually, a performer expresses interest in song, but without a producer, it cannot reach public. The producer assumes all risks, making a substantial financial investment while calculating potential losses.”"

Acar noted that despite difficulties faced, Sumud Fleet represented a very important initiative thanked all activists who risked their lives on this dangerous journey. He continued: “Zionist Israel continues its attacks despite ceasefire, its patrons openly maintain their support. Over two billion Muslims have not gone beyond merely observing what has happened over past two years. Our country has certain initiatives, many of which remain out of public eye; however, they are not sufficient. This is because ummah has not achieved unity.” GÜRPINAR: “I DID NOT HESITATE WHEN I WAS INVITED TO JOIN SUMUD” Television host author İkbal Gürpınar , who described herself as a mufti’s daughter an imam hatip high school graduate, admitted that she became well-informed about Palestine, Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa later in life.

Gürpınar asked participants: “How can you tell if a country is free?” She explained that Palestinians who have no army, currency, industry, or travel rights derive their freedom from their strong faith. Reflecting on her invitation to join Sumud Fleet, she said: “A few weeks earlier, I had broken my shoulder, my arm was in a sling. Yet I did not hesitate to participate. My only question was: ‘Will they accept me?’ We were supposed to depart next day, but we were held in Tunisia for 13 days. Our captains were threatened, their licenses revoked, our ships sabotaged. On day of departure, only 13 of 50 ships could set sail. Everyone had a single goal: to break blockade.” ASLAN: “DON’T LET GAZA FALL OFF YOUR AGENDA” Businessman Sumud activist Umut Aslan said that a new path of resistance has emerged over past two years. He explained that Gaza resistance marked a turning point in his life, noting that he has been to Jerusalem twice in last two years now divides his life into “before Jerusalem” “after Jerusalem.” Pointing to Türkiye’s important role in struggles of Palestinians other oppressed peoples, Aslan advised young people: “Do not let Gaza fall off your agenda. Make space for one more file in your daily schedule name it ‘Jerusalem Gaza.’ Pass on this cause which you support today to your children as well.”"

    "content": "Kanat: America at a Crossroads 01.12.2025 Assoc. Prof. Dr. Kılıç Buğra Kanat, Member of Security Foreign Policies Council of Presidency of Republic of Türkiye, spoke at Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University about impact of four major crises United States has experienced over past twenty years on global dynamics. Kanat who is also a faculty member at Penn State University Research Director at SETA-Washington D.C. participated in program organized by IZU Department of Political Science International Relations Politics Club. As guest speaker of conference titled “America’s Longest Twenty Years: The History of America in Four Crises” held at Abdullah Tivnikli Conference Hall, he evaluated how crises U.S. has faced in last two decades have affected state governance foreign policy preferences. Delivering opening remarks, IZU Rector Prof. Dr. Ahmet Cevat Acar underscored importance of hearing such evaluations from an academic who closely observes United States: “Since Second World War, America has been an ally of Türkiye. With its far-reaching global ties, changes happening there leave deep impacts on world politics,” he said. “THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DOES NOT WANT WAR” During session moderated by Vice Rector Prof. Dr. Erhan İçener, Kanat discussed how period beginning with 9/11 continuing through Iraq War, 2008 Economic Crisis, ending with 2020 Covid Pandemic has shaped U.S. governance foreign policy. Highlighting American public’s reluctance toward large-scale foreign engagements, Kanat stated, “To understand today’s U.S. policy, one must carefully examine last century.” He explained how society’s inward-looking tendency influenced elections: “The victories of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Donald Trump were driven by their focus on domestic issues during their campaigns. The American people do not want foreign policy to overshadow their own concerns.” KANAT: 9/11 HAS NOT ENDED Kanat pointed out that U.S. experienced crises similar to recent ones in early 20th century, but difference today is that these crises do not reach a conclusion. “Japan’s Pearl Harbor attack was a shock similar to 9/11. In response, America dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima Nagasaki, Pearl Harbor was over. But despite wars in Afghanistan Iraq, 9/11 has not ended. The other crises America has faced in past twenty years also remain unresolved.” “AMERICA IS AT A CROSSROADS” Noting growing anti-war sentiment in U.S. public sphere, Kanat remarked: “America is at a crossroads. There is a strongly anti-Israel faction, but their anger is not about Gaza; it’s about belief that their country has been dragged into war.” He added that Trump’s plan for 2026 elections points toward a more inward-looking foreign policy. “THE WORLD SYSTEM IS CHANGING” Emphasizing that global system is being reshaped, Kanat stated that political landscape is moving toward a multipolar structure reminiscent of pre–World War II era. Addressing Türkiye–U.S. relations, he noted that ties between two countries have been driven by security concerns since beginning. “In every crisis we have experienced with U.S. since Second World War, Congress has played an active role. In records of Sivas Congress, we see Rauf Orbay complaining about negative stance of American Congress, just like today’s politicians,” he said. Kanat identified two additional key factors straining bilateral relations: relations with Russia weapons policies."

Organized in collaboration with Middle East Foundation, Turkish Journal of International Development, Omran Strategic Research Center, IZU, supported by Presidency for Turks Abroad Related Communities (YTB) TİKA, symposium addressed Syria’s reconstruction process in fields of education, economy, human capital, law.

ACAR: NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT IS CRUCIAL In his opening speech, IZU Rector Prof. Ahmet Cevat Acar recalled that millions of Syrians were displaced tens of thousands lost their lives during 14-year conflict. He emphasized importance of justice, return of confiscated rights, access to education healthcare in reconstruction process. Acar stated, “Establishing political unity is also very important. The international order represented by UN has collapsed. At this stage, national international support is critical. The failure of Arab countries to fulfill their responsibilities has been a great disappointment. If we do not increase our cooperation, what happened in Syria yesterday could happen to us tomorrow.” KAHF: MORE THAN 50,000 SYRIAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN TURKEY Ammar Kahf, Executive Director of Omran Strategic Research Center, highlighted serious lack of knowledge vision in Syria’s reconstruction. He said, “It is crucial to establish healthy relations with neighboring countries. We are aware of significance of Turkey opening its doors to millions of Syrians. Academic studies will shed light on reconstruction efforts. During war, Syrian academia declined, but millions who had to leave continued working elsewhere. Currently, Turkey hosts over 50,000 Syrian students at undergraduate graduate levels.” ÖZCAN: PROBLEMS CONTINUE IN SYRIA Prof. Mesut Özcan, Chair of Middle East Foundation, emphasized importance of holding symposium one year after Syrian revolution on December 8, 2024. He stated, “Significant change has started in Syria, but challenges questions persist. On first anniversary of revolution, we gathered to discuss what needs to be done to overcome them,” addressing difficulties of rebuilding cities, education, healthcare, other sectors. ÇELİK: RECONSTRUCTION HAS BEGUN RAPIDLY The first session, titled “Rebuilding Human Capital in New Era,” focused on Syria’s education system during reconstruction period. Prof. Zafer Çelik from Yıldırım Beyazıt University noted that a rapid reconstruction process began after December 8. He highlighted ongoing efforts to restructure curriculum, address teacher shortages, improve access to education. Çelik added, “Many projects are either partially implemented or in planning stages with Western countries, Arab world, Turkey. International organizations must honor their commitments to improve infrastructure make education system functional.” ATABAŞ: HUMAN RESOURCES NEEDED FOR SYRIA ARE IN THE DIASPORA Hacer Atabaş from Africa Foundation emphasized role of universities in rebuilding state, restructuring socio-economic policies, ensuring social cohesion for war-affected population, establishing political stability. She noted that 14-year conflict disrupted academic institutions caused a significant brain drain. Atabaş said, “The war destroyed education system. The human resources needed for reconstruction are in diaspora. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians continued their education abroad. If diaspora’s human capital returns, much of workforce need can be met.” DEMİR: ACADEMIC FREEDOM MUST BE GUARANTEED Sociologist Ayyüce Şahin Demir highlighted that higher education in Syria began in 1903 with Ottoman-established medical faculty in Damascus that by 2011, 22 universities were operational nationwide. Despite extensive destruction caused by war, higher education resumed rapidly after December 8. Demir emphasized importance of returning diaspora academics, stating conditions needed: “Academic freedom must be guaranteed. Physical infrastructure should be strengthened, solutions should be developed for housing needs of students academics.” MERT: ACADEMICS READY TO SUPPORT Mehmet Ali Mert from Recep Tayyip Erdoğan University, final speaker of session, discussed role of diaspora academics in reconstruction. He emphasized that political stability is a prerequisite for their return: “State policies are important. Our discussions show that academics living abroad are ready to contribute.

    "content": "İsmail Hakkı Bursevi on 300th Anniversary of His Passing 03.12.2025 The Great Islamic thinker, Celveti sheikh, commentator, poet İsmail Hakkı Bursevi is being commemorated on 300th anniversary of his passing. At panel held at IZU, Mahmut Erol Kılıç Assoc. Ahmet Murat Özel discussed Bursevi's scholarly, mystical, literary legacy. The panel titled \"İsmail Hakkı Bursevi on 300th Anniversary of His Passing\", organized by Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University Sufi Studies Research Center (İSTAM), took place at Abdullah Tivnikli Conference Hall. Moderated by Hasan Kamil Yılmaz, Dean of IZU Faculty of Islamic Sciences, panel hosted IRCICA Director General Mahmut Erol Kılıç Istanbul Medeniyet University faculty member Assoc. Ahmet Murat Özel. ACAR: \"BURSEVİ İS A GUIDING NORTH STAR\" Speaking at opening of panel, IZU Rector Ahmet Cevat Acar described İsmail Hakkı Bursevi as \"a figure who guides us like a North Star in Today's darkness.\" Acar said: \"İsmail Hakkı Bursevi represents profile of what ancients called 'double-winged'. He was well-versed in rational sciences while also being one of leading figures in spiritual sciences. Recognizing such figures is an expression of respect for spiritual heritage they left behind.\" YILMAZ: ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC OTTOMAN SCHOLARS Hasan Kamil Yılmaz, Dean of IZU Faculty of Islamic Sciences, emphasized Bursevi was among most prolific Ottoman authors. Calling him \"a man of balance a profound Sufi,\" Yılmaz noted Bursevî masterfully used both Arabic Turkish, his tafsir Ruh al-Bayan is considered a significant work among Ottoman scholars. KILIÇ: “SUFISM LIES AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCES” Mahmut Erol Kılıç began by reminding audience Sufism was traditionally considered foundation of all sciences in pre-modern world. He pointed out modern era detached itself from this princible, leading to claim each discipline stands on its own. Addressing Bursevi's detailed treatment of concept of inner/esoteric politics, Kılıç said this perspective offered a Sufi conceptual framework for understanding Ottoman state structure. He added Bursevî’s writings across different fields should not be seen as scattered: “In their world of meaning, all sciences serve same purpose. A life or human being without meaning is unimaginable. Spiritual sciences give meaning to concepts. What makes us who we are is this meaning. The role of prophets saints is to breathe meaning back into souls remind us of true essence of religions risk remaining mere rituals.” ÖZEL: “BURSEVÎ IS A RIPE FRUIT OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE” Discussing Bursevî’s poetic dimension, Assoc. Ahmet Murat Özel stated Bursevî, as a scholar, commentator, Sufi, traveler, poet, left behind a rich corpus. “Born in mid-1600s, during Ottoman Empire’s stagnation period, Bursevî is a ripe fruit of Ottoman intellectual tradition,” he said. Özel emphasized themes of love spiritual guidance stand out in his poetry, everyday details within his verses offer valuable biographical insights. The program concluded with a musical performance in which ilahis composed from Bursevî’s poems were sung by Mehmet Öncel, Chair of IZU Music Education Department."

Ancak, final sınavının dersin ağırlıklı not ortalamasına katkı oranı %50’den az olamaz. b) Değerlendirme: Öğrencinin; ara sınav(lar)ı, kısa sınav(lar)ı, yarıyıl içi çalışmaları ile final sınavı katkı oranlarına göre hesaplanan ağırlıklı ortalamasını, sınıftaki o dersi alan tüm öğrencilerin puanlarını dikkate alarak, düzeyini belirleyen sistemdir. c) Değerlendirme Katma Limiti (BDKL): alınacak notlarının 100 puan üzerinden belirlenen alt sınırıdır. Bu sınır tüm birimlerde ham puanı 15 olarak uygulanır. BDKL altında kalan öğrencilere doğrudan FF notu verilir. Bu öğrenciler bağıl katılmaz. ç) Başarı Katsayısı: Harflerle belirlenen notunun 0.00 ile 4.00 aralığındaki karşılığıdır. d) Başarı Notu Alt Limiti (BNAL): Bir dersten ya da uygulamadan başarılı olmak için gerekli notu alt sınırı 30 olarak uygulanır. Bu notun altında kalan öğrenciler başarısız sayılır ve doğrudan FF notu verilir. Ancak bu öğrencilerin notları bağıl dahil edilir. e) Değerlendirme: Öğrenci puanını ölçütle karşılaştırarak değer yargısına ve/veya karara varma işlemidir. f) Ham Başarı Notu: Öğrencinin derste aldığı ara sınav(lar)ı, kısa sınav(lar)ı, yarıyıl içi çalışmaları ile final sınavı notlarının, belirlenen ağırlıklarla hesaplanarak 100 üzerinden elde edilen nottur. g) Not: Öğrenci puanlarının ölçütle karşılaştırılarak varılan değer yargısı ya da karar ifadesinin göstergesi olan harf ya da sayısal değerdir. ğ) Ölçme: Öğrenci başarısının gözlemlenerek gözlem sonuçlarının sayı veya sayı sembolleri ile belirlenmesidir. Öğrenci başarısı 100’lük puanla belirlenir. h) Final Sınavı Alt Limiti (FSAL) : Bir dersten veya uygulamadan başarılı olmak için gerekli final sınavı notu alt sınır değerini ifade eder. Final sınavı alt sınır değeri 30 olarak uygulanır. 100 puan üzerinden 30’nin altında not alan öğrenciler başarısız sayılır ve bu öğrencilere doğrudan FF notu verilir. Ancak bu öğrenciler bağıl dahil edilir. Değerlendirme Uygulama Esasları MADDE 5- (1) Değerlendirme uygulama esasları üç farklı yöntemle belirlenir.

Kabul 9 - Başvuruların değerlendirilmesi Dekanlık belirlenen komisyon yapılır ve Fakülte Yönetim Kurulunca karara bağlanır. Başvuruların değerlendirilmesi; adayların ağırlıklı genel not ortalaması, eğer varsa ortak derslerdeki başarısı, Üniversiteye kaydolduğu yıldaki ve puan türündeki ÖSYS/YKS puanının %40’ı hesaplamaya dahil edilerek yapılır. DGS yaptırmış programlar başvurularında yapılacak hesaplamalarda, öğrencinin DGS yaptırdığı programının geldiği Üniversitedeki yıldaki YKS taban puanı kullanılır. (3) Genel başarı puanı hesaplanırken, tüm adayların ağırlıklı genel not ortalamaları Üniversitemizin 4’lük Sistemindeki Notların 100’lük Sistemindeki Karşılıkları tablosu esas alınarak dönüştürülür. (4) Başvuruların kontenjanı aşması halinde; genel başarı puanı en yüksek olan adaydan başlanarak kontenjan kadar asil ve kontenjan kadar yedek aday belirlenir ve ilan edilir.

    "content": "Wikilala (Osmanlı Dijital Kütüphanesi - Ottoman Digital Library) deneme erişimine açılmıştır. 09.06.2021 Wikilala nedir? Wikilala matbaanın icadından sonra basılmış Osmanlıca metinler (gazete, dergi, kitap ve belge) içerisinde \"arama\" yapılmasına olanak sağlayan bir dijital kütüphanedir. Meraklıların veya akademik çalışmalar yapan araştırmacıların halihazırda Osmanlıca metinlerde latin harfleriyle arama yapabilmelerine imkân tanıyan bir kütüphane bulunmamaktadır. Dijital baskı çağına gelinceye dek araştırmacılar Osmanlıca metinler içerisinde aradıklarını bulabilmek için sayfalarca konu başlığını taramak, hatta satır satır metin okumak zorundaydılar. Oysa Wikilala sayesinde tek bir hamle aradıkları tüm başlık ve içeriklere saliseler içerisinde ulaşabilirler. Sistem nasıl çalışır? Harf devriminden yani 1928 öncesi yayınlarda arama yapmak Wikilala’dan önce şu şekilde yapılıyordu. Mesela elinizde “Osmanlı dönemi Türkiye ve Amerika ilişkileri” hakkında bir araştırma konusu var. Bunun için konu ilgili Osmanlı döneminde çıkmış bütün gazetelerin haber başlıklarını veya köşe yazılarını samanlıkta iğne arar gibi baştan sona okumalısınız ki ilgili konuya veya içeriğe ait bilgiye erişesiniz. Oysaki Wikilala’da tek bir hamle aradığınız tüm içerik ve başlıklara bir saniyenin altında ulaşabilirsiniz. Arama kutusuna konu ilgili iki anahtar kelimeyi (örneğin; Türkiye Amerika) yazdığınızda bu iki kelimenin geçtiği Osmanlıca gazete, dergi veya kitapları listeleyebilir ve hangi sayısının, sayfasının kaçıncı satırda olduğunu işaretli şekilde erişebilirsiniz. Dilerseniz doküman içerisinde de latin veya arap harfleri doküman içi arama yapabilirsiniz. Önemli Hatırlatma: Gazete, dergi, kitap vs. dokümanların görüntü kalitesi yüksek boyutlarda olduğu için bilgisayar kullanılmasını tavsiye ediyoruz. Mobil de kullanılabilir. Erişim ve Giriş Hakkında Wikilala’ya üniversite içerisinden erişim sağlamak için kurumunuzun internet ağı bağlantı sağlamanız gerekmektedir. Kampüs dışı erişim sağlamak için kurum e-posta adresi giriş yapabilirsiniz. Giriş için; 1- Web sitesinde yer alan “kayıt ol” butonuna tıklayınız. 2- İlgili boşlukları eksiksiz doldurunuz. (e-posta kısmına kurum mailinizi giriniz.) 3- Kullanıcı sözleşmesini gözden geçiriniz. 4- “Kayıt ol” butonuna tıklayıp giriş yapabilirsiniz .Keyifli araştırmalar dileriz.

Bu konuda bir yanlış anlamayı önlemek için bilgilendirmek istiyoruz. Pandemi tedbirleri dolayısıyla 2020 yılı Mart-Haziran aylarında Kütüphanenin de kapalı dönemlerde “gecikme cezası uygulanmayacağı” duyurulmuştu. Bu nedenle yeni eğitim öğretim yılı başlayana kadar, 10 Mart-10 Ekim 2020 tarihleri arasında gecikme cezası uygulanmamıştır. 2020-2021 öğretim yılı başladığında normal çalışma düzenine geçildiği, pandemi tedbirleri nedeniyle Kampüse gelemeyen öğrencilerimizin kargo ile ödünç kitap alabileceği, aynı şekilde süresi dolan kitapların da kargo ile iade edilebileceği web sayfamızda duyurulmuştur. E-Posta veya telefonla soranlara da gerekli bilgi verilmiştir. Buna rağmen bazı öğrencilerimiz 7 ay uygulanmayan gecikme cezasını “hiç uygulanmayacakmış” gibi yorumlayıp kitapları iade etmemiş ve cezalı duruma düşmüştür. Biz öğrencilerimizi sıkıntıya sokmak istemeyiz. Gereken kolaylığı göstereceğiz, ama cezaların tamamen silinmesi de söz konusu değildir. Ödünç aldığı kitapları iade etmeyen öğrencilerin mezuniyeti için onay verilmesi, ilişik kesilmesi de mümkün değildir.

Bu nedenle Kurum dışından olup da herhangi bir sebeple kütüphanemizi kullanmak isteyenler için 1.000 (bin) kişilik kontenjan ayrılmıştır. Gelen yoğun talep dikkate alınarak çoğunluğu üniversite sınavına hazırlanan lise son sınıf öğrencisi veya mezunu olmak üzere toplam 1.100 kişi kaydedildi. Bu kişiler Kütüphanemizi düzenli olarak kullanmaktadır. Bu sayının daha fazla olması halinde kendi öğrenci ve personelimiz için kullanım zorluğu, yer sıkıntısı ortaya çıkacağı muhakkaktır. Çevremizdeki insanlara daha fazla faydalı olmak isterken kendi öğrenci ve personelimize gerektiği gibi hizmet veremeyecek duruma düşmemiz de uygun olmaz. Bu nedenle üniversite sınavına hazırlanan veya başka üniversitelerin lisans öğrencisi olan kişilerin kütüphanemizden faydalanmak üzere kaydedilmesi işlemi Aralık 2018 ortalarında sonlandırılmıştır. Şu ana kadar kaydedilmiş kişiler Temmuz ayına kadar kütüphanemizi kullanmaya devam edebilir. Temmuz ayından itibaren listeler silinecek ve kayıtlar yeniden yapılacaktır.

Öğrencinin programlararası başvurusu yapabilmesi aşağıdaki şartları sağlaması gerekir; a) Öğrencinin, yabancı dil hazırlık sınıfı hariç, kayıtlı olduğu programda en az yarıyıl görmüş olması, b) Öğrencinin istediği sekiz yarıyıllık öğretim planındaki yarıyıla kadar olan tüm dersleri almış ve ortak dersleri başarmış olması, c) Öğrencinin ağırlıklı genel not ortalamasının 4.00 üzerinden en az 2.50 olması, ç) Öğrencinin, Kınama hariç disiplin cezası almamış olması. 2. Öğrencinin programlararası başvurusu yapılabilmesi için; merkezi yerleştirme sınavına girdiği yıl itibarıyla istediği programı geçerli olan puan türünde aldığı merkezi yerleştirme puanının, istediği eşdeğer yurt içindeki üniversitelerin programlarının (KKTC’deki üniversitelerin programları hariç) en düşük taban puanından az olmaması gerekir. (Ek puansız yerleştirme puanının sırası dikkate alınır.) Müzik yurt genelinde sadece özel yetenek sınavı öğrenci alımı yapıldığından ve yurt içi en düşük puan şartı kontrol edilemediğinden programlar arası başvurusu yapılamaz. 3. Programlararası geçişler yalnızca 2., 3., 4. ve 5. yarıyıllara yapılabilir. 4. Özel Yetenek Sınavı öğrenci alan programlarına programlar arası başvurusu öğrencilerin diğer şartların yanı sıra Üniversite yapılacak yetenek sınavından da başarılı olmaları gerekir. 5. Öğrenciler sadece defa programlararası yapabilir, (Üniversitemiz içinde daha önce programlararası öğrencilerin tekrar programlararası yapama hakkı yoktur) ancak, bu öğrenciler ÖSYS merkezi yerleştirme sonucu yaptırdıkları programa daha sonraki başvuru dönemlerinde, başvuru ve şartlarını sağladıkları taktirde geri dönebilir. 6. Programlararası başvuruları akademik takvimde ilan edilen tarihlerde üzerinden online olarak yapılır. ÖZEL ŞARTLAR: 1. Mühendislik ve Doğa Bilimleri Fakültesi Eğitim Fakültesi programlarına isteyen puan türündeki ÖSYS sırasının, YÖK yıl belirlenen asgari sınırına eşit yüksek olması gerekir. 2.

Üniversite programlarına kurumlar arası kurum içi yatay isteyen önceki olduğu merkezi yerleştirme puanı, Üniversitede istediği aynı burslu indirimli taban puanına eşit yüksek ise; öğrenci istediği ÖSYM puanının karşılık geldiği burslu indirimli programa burs/indirim oranıyla yerleştirilir. a) Yatay öğrenciye verilen burs ve indirimler kayıtlı olunan normal süresince geçerlidir. b) Eşdeğer programa kurumlar arası kurum içi yatay ve bursluluk süreleri hesaplanırken, önceki programında geçirmiş olduğu süreler bu hesaplamalara dahil edilir. c) Farklı programa kurumlar arası kurum içi yatay ve bursluluk süreleri, edildiği yeni programın azami süresinden intibakının yapıldığı sınıf çıkartılarak yeniden hesaplanır. 5. Üniversitede kurum içi yatay öğrenciler, destek bursu, kardeş, eş ve personel bursları haricindeki önceki özgü diğer burs ve indirimlerden (Akademik Başarı Bursu, Tercih Bursu vb.) yararlanamaz. İstanbul Sabahattin Zaim Üniversitesi Arası Yönergesi tıklayınız > > > Başvuruların Değerlendirilmesi Başvuruların değerlendirilmesi Dekanlık belirlenen komisyon yapılır ve Fakülte Yönetim Kurulunca karara bağlanır. Başvuruların değerlendirilmesi; adayların ağırlıklı genel not ortalaması, eğer varsa ortak derslerdeki başarısı, Üniversiteye olduğu ve puan türündeki ÖSYS/YKS puanının %40’ ı hesaplamaya dahil edilerek yapılır. DGS yaptırmış öğrencilerin yatay başvurularında yapılacak hesaplamalarda, DGS yaptırdığı geldiği Üniversitedeki YKS taban puanı kullanılır. Genel puanı hesaplanırken, tüm adayların ağırlıklı genel not ortalamaları Üniversitemizin “4’lük Sistemindeki Notların 100’lük Sistemindeki Karşılıkları” tablosu esas alınarak dönüştürülür. Başvuruların kontenjanı aşması halinde; genel puanı en yüksek olan adaydan başlanarak kontenjan kadar asil ve kontenjan kadar yedek aday belirlenir ve ilan edilir. Adayların genel puanının eşit olması durumunda, ÖSYS/YKS puanı yüksek olana öncelik verilir. İşlemleri Arası hakkı kazanan öğrencilerin Senato belirlenen “Kayıt Tarihleri”nde ıslak imzalı Arası Dilekçesi ve istenen belgelerle birlikte Öğrenci İşleri Daire Başkanlığına şahsen noter onaylı vekâletname belirledikleri vekilleri vasıtasıyla başvurmaları gerekir.

    "content": "Wikilala (Osmanlı Dijital Kütüphanesi - Ottoman Digital Library) deneme erişimine açılmıştır. 09.06.2021 Wikilala nedir? Wikilala matbaanın icadından sonra basılmış Osmanlıca metinler (gazete, dergi, kitap ve belge) içerisinde \"arama\" yapılmasına olanak sağlayan bir dijital kütüphanedir. Meraklıların veya akademik çalışmalar yapan araştırmacıların halihazırda Osmanlıca metinlerde latin harfleriyle arama yapabilmelerine imkân tanıyan bir kütüphane bulunmamaktadır. Dijital baskı çağına gelinceye dek araştırmacılar Osmanlıca metinler içerisinde aradıklarını bulabilmek için sayfalarca konu başlığını taramak, hatta satır satır metin okumak zorundaydılar. Oysa Wikilala sayesinde tek bir hamle aradıkları tüm başlık ve içeriklere saliseler içerisinde ulaşabilirler. Sistem nasıl çalışır? Harf devriminden yani 1928 öncesi yayınlarda arama yapmak Wikilala’dan önce şu şekilde yapılıyordu. Mesela elinizde “Osmanlı dönemi Türkiye ve Amerika ilişkileri” hakkında bir araştırma konusu var. Bunun için konu ilgili Osmanlı döneminde çıkmış bütün gazetelerin haber başlıklarını veya köşe yazılarını samanlıkta iğne arar gibi baştan sona okumalısınız ki ilgili konuya veya içeriğe ait bilgiye erişesiniz. Oysaki Wikilala’da tek bir hamle aradığınız tüm içerik ve başlıklara bir saniyenin altında ulaşabilirsiniz. Arama kutusuna konu ilgili iki anahtar kelimeyi (örneğin; Türkiye Amerika) yazdığınızda bu iki kelimenin geçtiği Osmanlıca gazete, dergi veya kitapları listeleyebilir ve hangi sayısının, sayfasının kaçıncı satırda olduğunu işaretli şekilde erişebilirsiniz. Dilerseniz doküman içerisinde de latin veya arap harfleri doküman içi arama yapabilirsiniz. Önemli Hatırlatma: Gazete, dergi, kitap vs. dokümanların görüntü kalitesi yüksek boyutlarda olduğu için bilgisayar kullanılmasını tavsiye ediyoruz. Mobil de kullanılabilir. Erişim ve Giriş Hakkında Wikilala’ya üniversite içerisinden erişim sağlamak için kurumunuzun internet ağı bağlantı sağlamanız gerekmektedir. Kampüs dışı erişim sağlamak için kurum e-posta adresi giriş yapabilirsiniz. Giriş için; 1- Web sitesinde yer alan “kayıt ol” butonuna tıklayınız. 2- İlgili boşlukları eksiksiz doldurunuz. (e-posta kısmına kurum mailinizi giriniz.) 3- Kullanıcı sözleşmesini gözden geçiriniz. 4- “Kayıt ol” butonuna tıklayıp giriş yapabilirsiniz .Keyifli araştırmalar dileriz.

Bu konuda bir yanlış anlamayı önlemek için bilgilendirmek istiyoruz. Pandemi tedbirleri dolayısıyla 2020 yılı Mart-Haziran aylarında Kütüphanenin de kapalı dönemlerde “gecikme cezası uygulanmayacağı” duyurulmuştu. Bu nedenle yeni eğitim öğretim yılı başlayana kadar, 10 Mart-10 Ekim 2020 tarihleri arasında gecikme cezası uygulanmamıştır. 2020-2021 öğretim yılı başladığında normal çalışma düzenine geçildiği, pandemi tedbirleri nedeniyle Kampüse gelemeyen öğrencilerimizin kargo ile ödünç kitap alabileceği, aynı şekilde süresi dolan kitapların da kargo ile iade edilebileceği web sayfamızda duyurulmuştur. E-Posta veya telefonla soranlara da gerekli bilgi verilmiştir. Buna rağmen bazı öğrencilerimiz 7 ay uygulanmayan gecikme cezasını “hiç uygulanmayacakmış” gibi yorumlayıp kitapları iade etmemiş ve cezalı duruma düşmüştür. Biz öğrencilerimizi sıkıntıya sokmak istemeyiz. Gereken kolaylığı göstereceğiz, ama cezaların tamamen silinmesi de söz konusu değildir. Ödünç aldığı kitapları iade etmeyen öğrencilerin mezuniyeti için onay verilmesi, ilişik kesilmesi de mümkün değildir. Kütüphane kılavuzu, çalışma saatleri, katalog tarama, veri tabanları, uzaktan erişim vs Kütüphane hakkında gerekli tüm bilgileri web sayfamızda bulabilirsiniz. https://www.izu.edu.tr/arastirma/kutuphane/izu-kutuphane Yeni dönemde Kütüphaneden en iyi şekilde yararlanmanızı, iade sürelerine dikkat ederek cezalı duruma düşmemenizi temenni eder, başarılar dileriz.

Çevremizdeki insanlara daha fazla faydalı olmak isterken kendi öğrenci ve personelimize gerektiği gibi hizmet veremeyecek duruma düşmemiz de uygun olmaz. Bu nedenle üniversite sınavına hazırlanan veya başka üniversitelerin lisans öğrencisi olan kişilerin kütüphanemizden faydalanmak üzere kaydedilmesi işlemi Aralık 2018 ortalarında sonlandırılmıştır. Şu ana kadar kaydedilmiş kişiler Temmuz ayına kadar kütüphanemizi kullanmaya devam edebilir. Temmuz ayından itibaren listeler silinecek ve kayıtlar yeniden yapılacaktır. Anlayışla karşılanması dileğiyle duyurur, başarılar dileriz. İZÜ Kütüphane ve Dokümantasyon Daire Başkanlığı"
